What This Project Does
This simulation demonstrates how platform constraints (like character limits, simplified interfaces, and algorithmic content prioritization) affect human communication patterns and linguistic complexity in real-time.
Key Research Question: Do digital platform constraints reduce the complexity of human thought and expression?

Features
Live Reddit Interface: Full Reddit-style interface with posts, comments, and voting
AI Comment Generation: Generate comments in 3 different constraint modes:

Normal: Natural conversational language
Casual/Slang: Constrained to slang terms and emojis only
Academic: Sophisticated vocabulary and complex sentences


Real-Time Analytics: Floating panel shows linguistic impact metrics
Human Response Simulation: AI generates realistic human responses to constrained language

What You'll See
Vocabulary Diversity: How constraints reduce language complexity
Communication Breakdown: When constrained comments become incomprehensible
Platform Impact: Real-time evidence of how interface design affects cognition

-----------------------
Note: This is a research tool designed to demonstrate platform constraint effects. Generate several comments with different constraint levels to see the full impact on communication patterns.
